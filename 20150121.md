* Add iptables block DHCP output from eno1 (for better safty).
* Meeting with the delegates from Dell and Inwin, after that, we found out that our network infrastructure needs some minute modifications to accomodate some modern design.
* Setup `dhcpd` in order to assign IP address when some of the machines need to use PXE to install their OS, currently the assignment is random, this have to switch to assign-using-MAC-address.
* Install `bind`, but it's not yet configured.
* Install `vsftpd` and `tftpd` to provide services for PXE boot, the boot image is extracted under `/var/ftp`, while the preboot image is locate under `/var/lib/tftpboot`.
* Kickstart scripts are placed under `<distro>/ks/ks.cfg`, the one that's contained in the CentOS 7 directory is properly configured to accomodate different setup of the NICs.
* SELinux and `firewalld` are configured respectively to accomodate the need of `vsftpd` and `tfptd`, where as SELinux is now configured to `permissive` mode.
* Set `LESSCHARSET="UTF-8"` to show the unicode characters properly.

## ToDo
* Use MAC address to assign the IPs.
* Assign hostnames and domain names using the DHCP service.
* Configure the DNS service.
