# 2016-01-27

 * Installed puppet master on Creator-Dev
 * Trying to install Razor using puppet (refer to [wiki](https://github.com/csie-cloud/wiki/wiki/Razor) )
    * Fail to install postgresql using puppet -> fixed (puppet module bug)
    * Installing razor
    
    
# TODO

* PXE is still to be fixed. (the Compass installation may also corrupt it...)
* Re-plug those network cable. It is planned that:
   * Discard Creator-Dev, since it has been contaminated by bunch of deployment tool's installaion). The machine may become a compute node in the future.
   * Merge dev enviroment into production enviroment.
   * Fix IPMI of machine that is now named Controller-Dev.
   * Settle the two IBM machines on the rack. (IPMI, power supply, network connection)
* If Razor is satisfiable, then redeploy service in Creator-Dev (which will be discard then) on Creator using puppet, including DHCP, DNS.
