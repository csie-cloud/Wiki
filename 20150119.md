* KVM installed.
* Configure network interface as: eno1 <-> virbr0 <-> fucking virtual NICs 
* VM images are stored under `/var/kvm/images`
* CentOS test VM installed, still have some network issue.
* Set up IPMI over lan, now we can access the console using IPMI through serial console.

### ToDo
* Can we remove `grub` and leave `grub2` in the `/boot`?
* Let the VMs in the creator-dev connect to the network through bridge mode, properly configure the bridge.
* Using `iptable` to port forward the ports that are required by PXE, TFTP, and puppet services.
