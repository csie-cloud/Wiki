* Start using r10k to help manage Puppet manifests with git.
  * Created repo `csie-cloud/cloud` (on github) as the main repo.
  * Created repo `csie-cloud/password` (on bitbucket) to host module password, which contains all the password used. 
  This repo is not on github bacause only public repo can be host in organization for free. 
  * The work flow is not that intuitive. Therefore, I may say more in wiki.
