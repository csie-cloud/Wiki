* dvr basically works, but floating ip accociation still have problem. Only found two places indicate something:

On compute1 `/var/log/neutron/openvswitch-agent.log `

Maybe you can see more by turning on debug mode of openvswitch-agent on compute node.

* Pass verify steps until step 8. Didn't create security group, that may be the reason.
* You can use `nova floating-ip-associate Lubuntu2 172.16.217.103` to associate a floating ip. Floating ip `172.16.217.103` has been created.
* The route table on compute1 is cleaned by me.
* Lots of bridge on compute1 are removed. I have 75% confidence that I did not kill a good guy.

# TODO

* Bridges including `br-ext`, `br-int` require IP to make everything work. Find a permanent way to get them IP when boot up.
* Will route table works after reboot
* Complete wiki about creating ovs bridge.
