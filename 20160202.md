# 2016-02-02

* Succefully verify nova.
* Neutron installed. But there exist a little problems
  * on compute node, service neutron-linuxbridge-agent.service fail to start.
* Horizon installed. It can create instance now. Howerver, after a while, the creation will fail since failure of network allocation. 

# Note
* The firewalld may be annoying. Take care! If a port is blocked, then `ssh -p [PORT] hostname` can tell you if it is blocked by firewalld. If the result is something like `no route to the host.` then it is firewalld to be blame. A hole on the wall is needed. If firewalld is not the causation, then `ssh -p` will tell you the connection is closed by peer.
* `[keystone_authtoken]` section can not be set as the official document teaches. Check our wiki for more infomation.
* ```nova list --all``` can list the instances running.
* `nova boot --flavor 1 --image 567ac1bd-c9a7-4ab8-8ce9-19853f51fdc3   --security-groups default  test-instance` can launch an instance.

# TODO
* neutron-linuxbridge-agent can be started only if turn off selinux.
* neutron seems to fail to "notify" something. Check `/var/log/neutron/server.log`.
* The vnc (console) in Horizon seems to not work. Maybe the vnc configuration of Nova needs some tweaks.
* The network now may have not enabled OVS. It require some trial and error.
