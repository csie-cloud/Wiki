* It's cold out there, we shall consider mixing the cold and hot aisle in the server room to achieve the optimal room temperature for humans. (You are sick.)
* Tried and give up KVM share folder, since it requires 9p to enable in the kernel - something that only recompile the kernel can achieve.
* Decide to not using VM in the creators, due to the reason and the complexities follow by it.
* Configuring PXE.
* Move RAID module to the rack.
* Enable IPMI of the creators and the controllers.
* Add physical switches to isolate the internal network.

## TODO
* Decide IP addresses in our inner network.
* Try if R610 can use IPMI on NICs other than NIC1.
  * If they can, disconnect them from VLAN 7.
* Connect the controllers' NIC1 or NIC2 to our inner network. Since they can only PXE boot on NIC1 or NIC2.
* Test PXE.
* Figure out how to boot Creator using Creator-Dev. (Maybe just connect Creator's NIC1 to Switch-Dev)
* Controllers's BIOS PXE is not setted.
