* I have no idea why it keeps showing `Exit code: 1` on `compute1` with the following message at `/var/log/neutron/openvswitch-agent.log`
  ```Command: ['ps', '--ppid', '17816', '-o', 'pid=']```
* After reading through discussions on compiling kernel module for RHEL7 system, it seems like people are treating this platform differently. Need more investigation to ensure that we don't really need another kernel module here. Or, rather just upgrade the one in our current system to 3.14 or so. We do have VXLAN support in kernel after reviewing the config file, which is also strange... and it's freaking activated.
