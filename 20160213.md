* I have no idea why it keeps showing `Exit code: 1` on `compute1` with the following message at `/var/log/neutron/openvswitch-agent.log`  
  ```Command: ['ps', '--ppid', '17816', '-o', 'pid=']```
* After reading through discussions on compiling kernel module for RHEL7 system, it seems like people are treating this platform differently. Need more investigation to ensure that we don't really need another kernel module here. Or, rather just upgrade the one in our current system to 3.14 or so. We do have VXLAN support in kernel after reviewing the config file, which is also strange... and it's freaking activated.
* Issue with the RAID storage is confirmed, SATA channel needs further configuration on the RAID controller before it can fully operational.

# ToDo
* Test `controller1` (previously we called it `controller2`), aka, razor node `node6`, for hard drive speed after HDD replacement and RAID rebuild procedure, it's still installing at the time of speaking, since I forget to trigger node reinstallation on the razor server after hard reboot.
