* Correct IP (192.168.217.0/24) and hostname of controller*
* Trying Puppet on controller3.
* Controller2 RAID firmware updated.

# Observation

* Controller2 dd performance is still slow. (48MB/s, after update firmware)
* IPMI IP address are messed up now! (DHCP)
* Openstack services are quite a mess now, since IP or whatever is drifting! Therefore, I cannot move on testing DVR floating IP.
